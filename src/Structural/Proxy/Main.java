Proxy pattern is used when we need to create a wrapper
 to cover the main objectâ€™s complexity from the client.

  Like Adapter pattern gives a different interface to its subject, while Proxy patterns provides the same interface from the original object but the decorator provides an enhanced interface. Decorator pattern adds additional behaviour at runtime.
